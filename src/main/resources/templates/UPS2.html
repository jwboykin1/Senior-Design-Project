          <p>Based on a quick look this logo looks legitimate, however after looking a little closer you can see <br> it is not. The color and positioning of the logo are slightly off! This is one of the reasons that you <br> need to be careful and not trust everything just because you see the logo of a company you trust.</p>

          <p>This email ships this item to "Sherlock Holmes" whom many should recognize from the fictional series. <br> Many times a phishing link will not have access to your name and will use a name or person that people <br> will recognize. In this case it is more for a learning purpose, but a name like "John Smith" could actually <br> catch some unaware users!</p>
          <p>The next section focuses on the "Tracking Number" and presents the user a link. It also says "(click for full Details)" <br> There are a couple key things wrong here, although the tracking number looks legitimate if you hover over it then it <br> displays a Youtube URL which is definitely not what the intended target of UPS Tracking is. In this training exercise <br> all of the links go to a simple Youtube redirect but in the case of an actual phishing attempt a user would be redirected <br> to a suspicious website where they could be fooled into putting in their username and password for a certain account. <br> It is important to keep this in mind as you continue through this course and continue in the online world.</p>

              <p>The Copyright information listed here is from 2017 which should throw up a flag as a reputable company like UPS would have this up-to-date.</p>
              <p>Just like the link above to the tracking number, if you hover over these two links they do not take you to the intended destination. You must <br> be careful with all links in a phishing email not just the first one that is presented, as attackers could hide multiple redirects in one message.</p>
